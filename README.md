<h1>Veneto Moda - Streetwear Fashion</h1>

Veneto Moda is a full responsive website built from scratch for educational purpose. 
The website is for a fictional streetwear store.

I really enjoy to develop this project but it's not finished yet (is still missing the contact page).

However, if you wanna take a look, you can find the site at the following link: http://danielemineo.altervista.org/veneto-moda
